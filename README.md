# Zip Crack by [Andrew Barlow](https://github.com/dandrewbarlow)

### Description
Messing around on youtube and found a vid about brute forcing password protected .zip files. I can't find it now, but it was made by [NeuralNine](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8wZnXYK_CGKlBcZp-GxYPA). Thought it'd be fun to implement his version python and try out some different languages to compare and contrast the experience. I currently have a version written in go working (and well imo). I'm new to go so I'm pretty proud of it and had a fun time making it. I certainly tried pretty hard to make a version in c++, but libzip gave me enough trouble that I'm putting that on an indefinite backburner. In my defense the library produces many false positives, and their documentation basically says thats the way it is, so I think that one's outside my purview. I'm leaving it here for educational purposes, however.
